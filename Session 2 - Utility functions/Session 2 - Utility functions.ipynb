    "## Static & Dynamic Code Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Static code analysis means analysing the code without executing it. \n",
    "The opposite naturally being dynamic code analysis where the analysis is performed by executing the code on a real or virtual processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of analysis have a lot of use cases but can e.g. provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "* find common security issues in the code (such as SQL injection vulnerabilities)\n",
    "* code linting against various standards/guidelines and/or style conventions\n",
    "* automatic code formating\n",
    "* autocompletion\n",
    "* measuring class cohesion\n",
    "* spell checking\n",
    "* measure code (cyclomatic) complexity\n",
    "* type checking\n",
    "* find unused classes, functions and variables \n",
    "* graphing imports/dependencies\n",
    "* run/execution timers\n",
    "* find program errors\n",
    "* find memory leaks,\n",
    "* find race conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following are the most important use cases you should know summarised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autocompletion\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocompletion is a tool constantly trying to predict the rest of what the user is typing. This is a must have and are  activated by default in most editors.\n",
    "For Python *Jedi* is one of the best. It's been heavily tested and seem to have a deeper understanding of Python than its competitors.\n",
    "The new kid on the block is *Kite* which uses Deep Learning to do multi-line predicts etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linting\n",
    "\n",
    "Code linters check that the formating of the code is inline with a selected style. This is a very useful tool that helps the user write more clear and readable code. Especially new users can benefit a lot from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using *Pycodestyle* (former *PEP8*) that highlights deviations from the well-known PEP8 Style Guide https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language with all the pros and cons that comes with. However, it is still possible to achive some of the benefints of statically typed language by using type hinting (specify types without impacting runtime) and then use static analysis to detect type errors/inconsistencies. Note that this is primarily relevant for larger Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type hinting:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age: int = 1  # This is how you declare the type of a variable type\n",
    "\n",
    "child: bool  # You don't need to initialize a variable to annotate it\n",
    "    \n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    child = True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    child = False\n",
    "\n",
    "# Built-in types\n",
    "from typing import List, Set, Dict, Tuple, Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is how you annotate a function definition\n",
    "def f(x: int, s: Sequence[int]) -> List[int]:\n",
    "\t...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unit testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit testing means that you predefine a series of code inputs for which you know what the outcome should be. By dynamic code analysis thess tests can be setup to automatically run on every single code commit immidiately informing the user if any of the tests fails.\n",
    "Unit testing and test converage gets relevant when you have a project many people rely on and you need to ensure correct behaviour during futher development.\n",
