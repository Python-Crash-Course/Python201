    "While the link between Python and Excel provided by *xlwings* is very convenient, it has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just like running macros in VBA, Ctrl-Z is not supported for undoing things. This can be quite frustrating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can be hard to modularize ones code when working with an Excel/Python interaction like *xlwings*. E.g. if you in a project write multiple useful macros and UDFs, translation to new workbooks/projects is not totally streamlined. How does one create a library of macros and UDFs to seamlessly import into new workbooks? There might be good solutions, in the future or already made, for this though. This sort of thing is much easier done in Python alone."

    "\n",
    "- Give the user a more helpful error message if the chosen `parameter` is not present as a column in the dataset. Currently, the dataset cannot be seen from inside Excel, so the user kind of has to \"guess\" the right string to put in. The default Pandas error is something like `\"Keyerror: ...\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even better than an error message: Read all column name from the dataset and create a drop down in Excel so only valid entries can be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make the plot prettier and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically update the plot when either parameter is changed to avoid having to press the button. If not this, at removing/emptying the plot if either parameter change would be good. This will prevent having the temporary \"wrong plot\" until the button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every time the \"update plot\" button is pressed, the code reads in the data as a dataframe and sorts it based on the date range and plotting parameter. This could be improved in many ways, everything from caching previously computed results to using a small database. This will speed up the code a lot and will probably be necessary if the plot should auto-update or if the dataset was larger.\n",
