    "# 7. Interact with Excel from Python and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple packages in the Python ecosystem that can talk to Excel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, many packages provide a way to import and export data to/from Excel. Pandas for instance, can export a dataframes as a Excel file and import a range of cells into a dataframe. This is however quite different from actually having a \"live\" connection between Python and Excel that can listen to individual cell values, run custom function etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This session focuses on the _xlwings_ (\"Make Excel fly\") 3rd-party library**, which creates a \"live link\" between Excel and Python. *xlwings* is free, open source and frequently updated as opposed to some other similar libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *This type of interaction between Excel and Python is best shown with an instance of both Excel and Python running at the same time. Therefore, the explanations given below should be seen as if there is an Excel spreadsheet running along side of the Python code shown.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***xlwings version:*** *The latest xlwings version at the time of writing this document is v0.18.0 and that is the version used in the Session code and the exercises. Both the session code and the exercises have been tested on v0.17.1 in an Anaconda environment as well. Version other than these might not work directly with the material.*\n",

    "\n",
    "### Anaconda (*conda*)\n",
    "Anaconda is a different Python distribution, which comes with Python installed and it has its own Package Index system. This means that the author(s) of a package need to put it on the Conda Package Index in order for others to be able to install it with `conda install package_name`. \n",

What *openpyxl* does is to write the Excel file in this format to create the resulting workbook. Or read from it if that is the use case. As a result, an Excel installation is not even needed to use *openpyxl*.\n"

E.g. if you in a project write multiple useful macros and UDFs, translation to new workbooks/projects is not totally streamlined. How does one create a library of macros and UDFs to seamlessly import into new workbooks? There might be good solutions, in the future or already made, for this though.

Currently, the dataset cannot be seen from inside Excel, so the user kind of has to \"guess\" the right string to put in. The default Pandas error is something like `\"Keyerror: ...\"`.\n",

    "- Make the plot prettier and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatically update the plot when either parameter is changed to avoid having to press the button. If not this, at removing/emptying the plot if either parameter change would be good. This will prevent having the temporary \"wrong plot\" until the button is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every time the \"update plot\" button is pressed, the code reads in the data as a dataframe and sorts it based on the date range and plotting parameter. This could be improved in many ways, everything from caching previously computed results to using a small database. This will speed up the code a lot and will probably be necessary if the plot should auto-update or if the dataset was larger.\n",
