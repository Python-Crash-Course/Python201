## Remotes - sharing work

Up until now we have only talked about local operations. I.e. operations where each person works alone on a local machine.

## Nomenclature

### `origin`

The *main* remote repository. When you connect your local repository to a remote one, the remote is automatically named `origin`. 

`origin` is the default name for a main remote repository just as `master` is the default name for the main branch.

### `origin/master`

### `pull`

### `push`

## Common Git operations with remote

```markdown
git push -u origin master
```

## Visualizing a two-person workflow

<***Insert diagram with two different machines and a remote repo. Each machine should periodically push and pull from master to share and retrieve updated work.***>
